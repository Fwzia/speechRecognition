# Speech Recognition

To install SpeechRecognition package is python, run the following command in the terminal and it will be installed on your system.

**pip install SpeechRecognition**

To use the microphones, we will have to install pyaudio module as well. We use the microphone class to get the input speech from the microphone instead of any other input method like an audio file.

Run the following command in the terminal or if you are using pycharm add the package from the project interpreter in the settings.


**pip install PyAudio**
